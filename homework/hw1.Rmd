1. Let $T$ be a positive random variable, show $E(T)=\int_0^\infty S(t) dt$.

2. e

3. Consider a survival time random variable with hazard $\lambda(t) = \frac{1}{10 - x}$ in $[0, 10)$.
    a. Plot the hazard function.
    b. Plot the survival function.

4. Consider a survival time random variable with constant hazard $\lambda = 0.1$ in $[0, 5)$, 
and $\lambda = 0.2$ in $[5, \infty)$. This is known as a piecewise constand hazard. 
    a. Plot the hazard function.
    b. Plot the survival function.

5. e
